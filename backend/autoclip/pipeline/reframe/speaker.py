"""Active speaker selection.

Two signals, combined:

**Mouth movement.** The variance of a track's mouth-aspect ratio over a window
rises while that person talks. On its own it confuses talking with chewing,
laughing, or nodding emphatically.

**Diarization.** Tells us *when* each speaker holds the floor, but not *which
face* they are. Correlating each track's mouth activity against each diarized
speaker's timeline resolves that once for the whole clip, after which turn
boundaries alone drive the framing — which is far more stable than deciding
frame by frame.

A full audio-visual model (TalkNet, LR-ASD) would beat this. It's on the v2 list;
this heuristic is what runs on a laptop without another 400 MB of weights.
